# C++ Env

This repository contains my configuration for developing c/c++ code in emacs. To use, run the following code:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/private
cd $_
git clone https://github.com/ausimian/spacemacs-cmake-ide
git clone https://github.com/saffronsnai/c-env.git
```

Then add `c-env` to your `spacemacs-configuration-layers` in init.el and your installation is finished.
